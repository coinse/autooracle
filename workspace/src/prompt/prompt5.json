You will be provided with the the associated method's comments and tests related to the new test. Your goal is to evaluate if the test oracle in the provided test code is correctly asserting the behavior of the method.

If the oracle uses the correct assertion method or exception structures, consider it <correct>; <incorrect> if it does not, and <undecidable> if the determination is not feasible."
