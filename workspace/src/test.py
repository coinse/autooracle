The oracle in test32 does not correctly test the behavior of the method. The expected behavior of the NumberUtils.createNumber method is to throw a NumberFormatException if the value cannot be converted to a number.

In the provided test, the try-catch structure is used to catch the expected NumberFormatException. However, the assertion is checking for "Expecting No exception" and fails if the exception is caught. This is incorrect because the test should pass if the exception is thrown and fail if no exception is thrown.

The correct way to test the behavior would be to use the assertThrows method to assert that a NumberFormatException is thrown when NumberUtils.createNumber is called with the given input string.

Here is the corrected version of the test:
```
@Test(timeout = 4000)
public void test32() throws Throwable {
    assertThrows(NumberFormatException.class, () -> {
        NumberUtils.createNumber("-0x%_5\"%Zbv?pz");
    });
}
```

Now the test correctly asserts that a NumberFormatException is thrown when the given input string is passed to the NumberUtils.createNumber method.
